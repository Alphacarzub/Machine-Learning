# Machine-Learning
This repository contains codes and datasets only for machine learning projects

## TRAIN.CSV -> Is original dataset downloaded from kaggle, It is based used cars data.
## Updated_dataset.csv -> Is the dataset that is obtained after pre-processing on original dataset. 
                          Only Null values are handled in this dataset. Further pre-processing is necessary to build model.

## Data pre-processing python-notebook -> contains code that is written to pre-process data of original dataset, specificially to handle null values.

## Dp_part1.ipynb -> Contains code that is intended to work on updated_dataset.csv, this notebook objective is to experiment with data by applying "One-Hot-Encoding" technique on all categorical variables.
                      Model built in on this pre-processed data is linear regression model and model is evaluated using several metrics like MAE,MSE,RMSE,R2,Adjusted_R2 score.
